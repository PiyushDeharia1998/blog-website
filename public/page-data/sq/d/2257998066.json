However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge was in 1959 for marketing a \"value version\" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger.\n\nFrom model years 1970 to 1974, the first generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler E platform in hardtop and convertible body styles sharing major components with the Plymouth Barracuda.\n\nThe second generation, from model years 1978 to 1983, was a badge engineered Mitsubishi Galant Lambda, a coupe version of an economical compact car.\n\nThe third and current generation is a pony car that was introduced in early 2008 originally as a rival to the evolved fifth generation Ford Mustang and the fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro\n"}}},{"node":{"title":"MustangBoss429","publishedDate":"2021-01-10T00:00+05:30","slug":"mustang","body":{"body":"If there's an ultimate Ford Mustang, it absolutely has to be the Boss 429. No other pony coming out of a Ford factory has ever matched its single-minded purpose and construction - take the nastiest corporate V8 (a NASCAR-spec big block), top it with some aluminum heads with giant ports, and shove it into the Mustang by chopping up the shock towers. Bake for a few weeks at Kar Kraft, then unleash it onto an unsuspecting public.\n\nToday, the Boss 'Nines are worth their weight in gold, and there just aren't enough to go around, with only 1359 being built in 1969 and 1970. So what's an enterprising Mustang fan from Iceland to do when a Mach 1 with a 428 just won't cut it? How about building your own Boss 429 tribute, then painting it badass black with a black interior for that extra sinister touch? This '69 Mustang is just such a car, and as soon as you hear it run, you'll stop wondering about performance potential and start reaching for your checkbook."}}}]}}}
